***About our Organization***
The International Airlines Technical Pool (IATP) is a convention of airlines made up of over 140 Member Airlines, 50 “Sponsored” Airlines, and over 45 OEM and service providers (called Associate Members). In the spirit of co-operation, members of the aviation industry gather twice yearly to discuss sharing of resources, reducing costs, while improving operating efficiency. Under its auspices, members “pool” (share) Aircraft Recovery kits, Spare Parts, Equipment, Line Maintenance and Aircraft Engines for both narrow and wide bodies.

The membership has grown to boast more than 500 delegates around the world, making it a diverse and multi-cultural community. There are no boundaries and every member is encouraged to bring forward their ideas, suggestions and opinions without any political prejudice. In the spirit of a "global village" environment, IATP promotes goodwill towards all its members, explores new directions within the frame of its mission, and respects the interest of all member airlines.

IATP is well known in the aviation world as the “best solution” to resolve quickly and efficiently AOG situations: the post-pandemic utilization of the IATP platform functionality for this emergency has doubled.

Within its 76-year history promoting unparalleled safety in the skies, this organization has not only contributed immensely to the aviation industry as we know it today, but has also forged strong bonds between airlines around the world. Competing airlines are united in the technical field. This bond, which began in 1948, was originally based solely on a gentlemen's agreement. Also, now its mission to provide excellent technical performance in aircraft operations is unmatched due to the high degree of mutual assistance from all member airlines.

IATP governance is assured by the Advisory Committee while the day-to-day activities are managed by the Management Board and Corporate Office team. Several Project Groups and Committees have been set up in order to address current industry challenges and maintain the IATP to the highest levels of expertise.
