client feedback:

Main points from the meeting with the Client on styling of the public website:

The IATP message : Put airlines together, for a win-win collaboration that maximizes efficiency, and expands global reach
IATA - not overlapping with IATP, it is more involved with the passengers (not-technical stuff)
IATP - more technical stuff
Why users access IATP web site?
Domestic flights expand their business and go abroad => they need to make sure there are specialized people who can help, in the destination airport abroad
Aircraft recovery - when in need, IATP ensures that their members are covered, wherever they are flying
IATP is Recognized by the world of aviation
There should be no real or identifiable aircraft on the website
Need a way to distinguish active from suspended airlines on the Airlines Members 
What is the target for IATP?
A potential member may receive technical support + AOG support, all over the world
Partnership with new airlines and extend partnership between airlines on more items (poolings)
Other metrics you want to improve?
To be useful for targeted users
Just informational for others
Do you use any social platform? Only LinkedIn
If IATP would look like a man, how would you describe him?
Old gentleman
Democratic 
Open minded, he accepts all airlines in the world
Expert on aviation
The next conference section on the website is one of the most important for users; at the end of each conference, IATP already puts on the website information about the next conference.
